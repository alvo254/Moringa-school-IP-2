Reasearch and development(R&D)
Findings and what i came across as new to me
1.<hr> tag which brings a line which can be edited as one desires.
2.Responsivnes using javascript as shown in script.js
- @ media screen
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.

Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.

Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.

Viewport defination-The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
I discoverd css refernce 
border style radius are like
border-bottom-right-radius
same as above but with left

fonts can be imported into html by the @symbol

This is just personal research done while trying to learn technologies to use in web development.
Unfortunately i am havig problems with responsiveness of the website will push an update on my pr0gress
